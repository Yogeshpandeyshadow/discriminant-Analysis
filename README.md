# discriminant-Analysis
Discriminant Analysis, often referred to as Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), is a statistical technique used for classification and dimensionality reduction. It is particularly useful when you have a dataset with two or more classes and you want to find a linear combination of features that characterizes or separates these classes.
